The Bioinformatics Hub of Kenya Intiative ([BHKi](https://bhki.org/)) is organizing a hackathon event (in-person and virtual) seminar series event, scheduled for **April 27th 2023**. 

### BHKi Kaggle Bioinformatics Hackathon: Exploring Public Datasets and Developing Novel Applications

The hackathonâ€™s goal is to create a platform for participants to upskill and use their skills to explore diverse publicly accessible bioinformatics datasets on Kaggle and develop innovative solutions to real-world problems using these datasets.
Bioinformatics projects and users are quite diverse, ranging from those who just use bioinformatics skills to be able to answer questions, to those who develop  pipelines to use in analysis, and those who design and develop tools for the other bioinformatics users to use. We also require more knowledge of bioinformatics in other areas that affect the field. 


## Objective:
The aim of this hackathon is to provide participants with an opportunity to explore various publicly available bioinformatics datasets on Kaggle, and develop innovative solutions to real-world problems using these datasets.

## Format:
The hackathon will be a virtual event, consisting of a week-long competition followed by a presentation and judging session. Participants will have access to several Kaggle bioinformatics datasets, as well as other relevant public datasets. They will work in teams of up to four members, with each team required to submit a final project report and a short video presentation showcasing their work.


Dataset:
Kaggle offers several bioinformatics datasets that can be used for various applications, including gene expression analysis, drug discovery, protein structure prediction, and disease diagnosis. Some of the relevant datasets that can be used for this hackathon include:

Gene expression datasets (e.g. GTEX, TCGA)
Drug discovery datasets (e.g. ChEMBL, PubChem)
Protein structure datasets (e.g. PDB, SWISS-MODEL)
Disease diagnosis datasets (e.g. MIMIC, Diabetic Retinopathy Detection)

Challenges:
Participants will be given the freedom to choose their own projects based on the datasets provided. However, some suggested challenges include:
-Developing a machine learning model to predict disease diagnosis using gene expression data
-Identifying potential drug candidates for a particular disease using drug discovery data
-Developing a tool for protein structure prediction using deep learning techniques
-Developing a web-based tool for exploring gene expression data

Prizes:
Prizes will be awarded to the top three teams, based on the judges' evaluation of their final project reports and presentations. The prizes could include cash awards, certificates, or other bioinformatics-related resources.


## Program
A detailed program of the hackathon event will be provided soon.
